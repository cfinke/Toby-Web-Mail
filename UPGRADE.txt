Upgrading to Toby Web Mail 0.5 from all previous versions
========================================================================
To upgrade to version 0.5 from all previous versions, simply overwrite all 
of the files from the old version with the files from this version, and 
then run the included upgrade.php script from your Web browser of choice.

If you want, you can delete all the old files before uploading the new files
to insure that you are not wasting space on files that have been removed from
Toby.
